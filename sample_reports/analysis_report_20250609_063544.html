                            <strong>Executive Summary of Key KPI Analyses:</strong>
<br>
1. <strong>Academic Performance by Major</strong>  
<ul>
<li>Students in technical majors like Computer Science and Engineering consistently achieve higher average exam scores compared to non-technical majors such as Arts, Psychology, and Biology.</li>
<li>The top-performing majors are Computer Science, Engineering, Business, Biology, and Psychology, while Arts, Psychology, Biology, Business, and Engineering appear in the bottom five, indicating nuanced performance differences requiring targeted support.</li>
</ul>
<br>
2. <strong>Gender and Exam Scores</strong>  
<ul>
<li>Exam scores are nearly identical across gender categories (Female, Male, Other), indicating gender is not a significant factor in academic achievement. Educational policies can therefore focus on other key success factors beyond gender.</li>
</ul>
<br>
3. <strong>Semester Trends in Exam Scores</strong>  
<ul>
<li>Exam scores remain stable across semesters with a slight improvement peaking mid-study (semester 5) and a dip in the final semester (semester 8), suggesting increased difficulty or stress. Support initiatives should focus on late-stage students to address this dip.</li>
</ul>
<br>
4. <strong>Study Hours and Academic Outcomes</strong>  
<ul>
<li>Computer Science students study more daily (~5 hours) than peers in other majors (~4 hours), which might reflect higher academic demands or competitiveness. However, the correlation between study hours and exam scores is weak (r=0.24), implying that study quality and other factors also heavily influence outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<br>
5. <strong>Attendance and Exam Performance</strong>  
<ul>
<li>Attendance percentages are uniformly high (~70%) across majors but show virtually no correlation with exam scores, suggesting attendance alone does not predict academic success. Universities might prioritize improving study habits and engagement over attendance metrics.</li>
</ul>
<br>
6. <strong>Dropout Risk and Its Drivers</strong>  
<ul>
<li>Dropout risk is low and consistent across majors, indicating stable student retention. However, students identified as at risk exhibit significantly higher stress levels (8.9 vs. 4.9) and exam anxiety scores (~10 vs. 8.5). This points to stress and anxiety management as critical areas for dropout prevention efforts.</li>
</ul>
<br>
7. <strong>Impact of Tutoring</strong>  
<ul>
<li>Access to tutoring positively impacts exam scores, validating investments in tutoring services and making such support widely accessible as a strategy to enhance student performance.</li>
</ul>
<br>
8. <strong>Motivation, Time Management, and Parental Support</strong>  
<ul>
<li>Higher exam score quartiles correspond with higher motivation levels, highlighting motivation as a strong success factor.</li>
<li>Stable, moderate time management scores (~5.5) are linked to better exam performance, suggesting cultivating time management skills is important.</li>
<li>Consistent parental support is observed across exam scores, with some correlation to academic success, emphasizing the value of family engagement.</li>
</ul>
<br>
9. <strong>Lifestyle and External Factors</strong>  
<ul>
<li>Regular exercise frequency correlates positively with exam scores, indicating physical activity may enhance academic outcomes and should be encouraged.</li>
<li>Sleep hours also correlate positively with exam success, reinforcing the importance of healthy sleep habits.</li>
<li>Screen time increases with higher exam scores, possibly reflecting productive use of digital resources, though balanced screen usage should be maintained.</li>
<li>Social media hours remain stable (~2.5 hrs/day) across exam brackets, suggesting limited impact on performance.</li>
<li>Diet quality and internet quality show no significant influence on exam scores in this dataset.</li>
<li>Part-time job status does not affect average exam scores, reassuring that work-study balance is generally manageable.</li>
</ul>
<br>
10. <strong>Study Environment and Learning Style</strong>  
<ul>
<li>Quieter, focused study environments like “Quiet Room” and “Library” associate with higher and more consistent exam scores compared to more distracting environments such as Dorms. Optimizing study environments is advisable.</li>
<li>Different learning styles do not yield significant exam score differences, supporting inclusive educational approaches without bias toward a specific style.</li>
</ul>
<br>
11. <strong>Socioeconomic Factors</strong>  
<ul>
<li>Family income shows minimal impact on exam score variation, suggesting equitable academic outcomes across income groups.</li>
<li>Higher parental education levels modestly correlate with better student exam performance, indicating potential benefits of informed parental involvement.</li>
</ul>
<br>
12. <strong>Extracurricular Involvement</strong>  
<ul>
<li>Preliminary insights suggest possible differences in exam scores related to extracurricular participation, warranting further investigation to inform holistic student development policies.</li>
</ul>
<br>
---<strong>Overall Business Recommendations:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Targeted Academic Support:</strong> Focus resources on non-technical majors with lower exam scores and on students in later semesters facing performance dips.</li>
<li><strong>Mental Health & Stress Management:</strong> Prioritize stress reduction and anxiety management programs, particularly for students flagged at dropout risk.</li>
<li><strong>Tutoring & Study Skills:</strong> Expand tutoring accessibility and invest in motivation and time management skill development initiatives.</li>
<li><strong>Health & Wellness Promotion:</strong> Encourage regular exercise and proper sleep hygiene as part of holistic student support strategies.</li>
<li><strong>Optimize Study Environments:</strong> Provide and promote quiet, focused study spaces to enhance academic performance.</li>
<li><strong>Equity & Inclusiveness:</strong> Continue fostering gender equity and socioeconomic inclusiveness, as these factors show minimal disparities in performance.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage Digital Tools:</strong> Recognize the potential role of screen time for productive studying while monitoring social media use.</li>
<li><strong>Parental & Family Engagement:</strong> Enhance outreach and communication to leverage parental education and support as a positive influence on students.</li>
</ul>
<br>
These insights provide a strategic foundation for policies and programs aimed at improving student academic outcomes, retention, and overall well-being across campus.

                                    The analysis reveals that average exam scores are very similar across different gender categories—Female, Male, and Other. Each category's average score hovers around 89, indicating minimal performance disparity by gender. This suggests that gender is not a significant factor in exam performance within this dataset. Consequently, educational interventions and policies should prioritize other determinants of academic success, such as study habits or motivation, since gender equity in academic achievement appears to be well maintained.

There is a slight upward trend peaking around semester 5, suggesting enhancements in learning or study habits as students advance. However, a dip occurs in semester 8, possibly due to increased course difficulty or final year pressures. Universities should focus on supporting students during this final semester to address these challenges and consider leveraging the middle semesters' positive momentum.

It then groups the data by the 'major' column and calculates the mean of 'study_hours_per_day' for each major, sorting the results in descending order. Using seaborn, it creates a bar plot to visualize the average daily study hours by major, customizing the plot size, labels, and title. The plot is saved as a PNG file and displayed for review.

                                    The analysis reveals that average attendance percentages across different majors are very similar, ranging narrowly from about 69.8% to 70.2%. Computer Science students have the highest average attendance at approximately 70.2%, followed closely by Arts and Psychology majors. Engineering students exhibit slightly lower attendance, though the difference is minimal. This consistency suggests that student engagement via attendance is broadly uniform across majors. Business-wise, this points to the potential effectiveness of university-wide attendance improvement initiatives rather than requiring major-specific strategies. Slight additional focus on Engineering might help understand and address its marginally lower attendance.

                                    The analysis reveals that across all majors in the dataset, the proportion of students at dropout risk ('Yes') is very low compared to those not at risk ('No'). This indicates a generally stable student population with respect to retention across different majors. The consistent low dropout risk implies that there are no major-specific dropout concerns. Business-wise, this suggests that retention efforts and resources should be focused on maintaining the supportive environment that currently sustains low dropout rates, while targeting early identification and support for the small subset of at-risk students rather than broad interventions by major.

                                    The analysis reveals a significant disparity in average stress levels between students who are at risk of dropping out and those who are not. Students classified as 'At Risk' exhibit a much higher average stress level (around 8.89) compared to their counterparts who are not at risk (approximately 4.93). This strong correlation suggests that elevated stress levels are a critical factor associated with dropout risk. Consequently, it highlights the importance for educational institutions to prioritize mental health interventions, stress management programs, and targeted support services for students flagged as at risk, which could be pivotal in reducing dropout rates and improving student retention.

                                    The analysis indicates that students who are identified as having a dropout risk tend to have higher exam anxiety scores on average compared to those who are not at risk of dropping out. Specifically, students with dropout risk have an average exam anxiety score around 10, whereas those without risk have an average near 8.5. This suggests exam anxiety is potentially an important factor related to dropout risk, implying that interventions aimed at reducing exam anxiety might help in lowering dropout rates.

                                    The analysis reveals a positive but weak correlation (r = 0.24) between students' study hours per day and their exam scores. This suggests that while increasing study hours tends to improve exam performance, the effect is modest and not consistent across all students. There is considerable variability in exam scores for any given study duration, indicating that factors beyond just study time, such as study quality, stress levels, and learning environments, significantly impact exam outcomes. Therefore, educational strategies should not only focus on encouraging more study hours but also on improving other influencing factors to enhance student performance more effectively.

                                    The analysis reveals that there is almost no linear correlation between students' attendance percentage and their exam scores. Despite intuition that attendance might improve exam outcomes, this dataset shows that exam performance remains largely unaffected by attendance rates. As a result, focusing solely on increasing attendance might not significantly boost exam results. This insight suggests that educational interventions should consider other factors influencing exam performance, such as study habits, motivation, or learning environment, to better support student success.

It reads the dataset containing student details, including their exam scores and part-time job status. The dataset is grouped by the 'part_time_job' column to compute the mean exam score for students with and without part-time jobs. After calculating these averages, the code creates a bar plot to visually compare the average exam scores between the two groups. Finally, the plot is saved to a file and displayed for review.

                                    The analysis focused on exploring the relationship between students' exam scores and their family income ranges. The key insight is that exam scores are relatively consistent across different family income groups (Low, Medium, High), with similar median scores and variability. This suggests that family income is not a significant factor influencing exam performance in this dataset, indicating a relatively equitable academic outcome regardless of income level. However, some outliers with lower scores were observed particularly in the Low and Medium income groups.

                                    The analysis investigates the average exam scores of students segmented by their learning styles: Auditory, Kinesthetic, Reading, and Visual. The results indicate that the average exam scores are very similar across all learning styles, all around an average score of 89 out of 100. Kinesthetic learners had the highest average score, though only marginally higher than the others, suggesting no statistically significant difference in exam performance by learning style. From a business perspective, this insight implies that educational programs and resources can continue to be designed to accommodate all learning styles without prioritizing one over another to improve exam outcomes. This inclusive approach ensures balanced investment in diverse teaching methods to support all students effectively.

                                    The analysis reveals that diet quality (categorized as Poor, Fair, Good) does not significantly impact average exam scores among students in the dataset. Average exam scores are consistently high and similar across all diet quality groups, indicating that other factors may have a more substantial effect on exam performance. This suggests that efforts to improve exam scores should potentially focus on factors beyond diet quality alone.

                                    The analysis investigates how students' average daily time spent on social media varies across different exam score brackets. The key insight is that social media usage remains relatively stable around 2.5 hours daily across all groups ranging from low to high exam scores. This suggests that social media engagement is not strongly associated with academic performance in this dataset. Consequently, any interventions aimed at reducing social media usage should not necessarily target students based on their exam score performance, as the behavior appears consistent across all levels. Further investigation could explore other factors influencing exam performance, such as study habits or time management patterns.

                                    The analysis reveals that students with higher exam scores generally exhibit stable and relatively consistent average time management scores, around 5.5. For lower exam scores, time management scores fluctuate more, showing some spikes and dips. The stabilization around mid-to-high exam scores suggests good time management is linked to better academic performance. This insight highlights the importance of improving time management skills to support students aiming to improve or maintain high exam scores. Educational institutions could focus on interventions to enhance these skills, potentially boosting overall student performance.

                                    The analysis explores the relationship between students' mental health ratings and their exam scores. Findings indicate that while a strong linear correlation is not evident, higher mental health ratings tend to associate with higher exam scores. Students with better mental health ratings (around 7 to 10) generally achieve higher exam scores, suggesting that mental wellbeing can positively influence academic performance. This insight supports the idea that initiatives aimed at improving students' mental health could contribute to better academic outcomes, although other factors also influence performance and should be examined further.

                                    The code begins by importing necessary libraries: pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib and seaborn for visualization. It loads the data from a specified CSV path. It then selects the two relevant columns — mental_health_rating and exam_score — for the key performance indicator (KPI) analysis. Summary statistics are computed to understand data distribution and central tendencies for these columns. Subsequently, a scatter plot is generated using Seaborn to visualize any trends or relationships between mental health ratings and exam scores among students. The plot is saved to a PNG file and displayed. Finally, the code outputs the summary statistics for further inspection.

                                    The analysis reveals a positive correlation between exercise frequency and exam scores among students. Increasing the number of times students exercise weekly is associated with higher average exam scores. This insight suggests that promoting regular physical activity could enhance academic performance by potentially improving cognitive function, reducing stress, or boosting overall well-being. Educational institutions might leverage this finding to integrate wellness programs focused on physical exercise to foster better academic outcomes.

                                    The analysis reveals differences in student exam performance based on the type of study environment. Students studying in quiet, focused environments like a 'Quiet Room' tend to have higher median exam scores and less variability, indicating consistent performance. Environments such as 'Co-Learning Group' and 'Library' also support relatively high median scores but with more score variability. Conversely, studying in 'Dorm' environments is associated with lower median exam scores and a wider score range, suggesting less consistent or poorer performance. The 'Cafe' setting has intermediate performance metrics. These insights suggest that study environments that minimize distractions and noise could positively impact academic outcomes. Educational institutions and students can use this information to optimize study spaces and strategies to enhance exam results.

                                    The analysis reveals that the average parental support level is generally moderate to high and remains relatively stable across various exam score ranges from around 50 to 100. This suggests that students with higher exam scores tend to have consistent parental support. There are some fluctuations in parental support for very low exam scores (below 50), which may be less reliable due to fewer data points. The business insight here is that parental support correlates with better exam performance, indicating that educational institutions and policymakers could focus on enhancing parental involvement to potentially improve student outcomes.

                                    The analysis reveals that students with higher exam score brackets tend to have higher average screen time. Specifically, the average screen time increases progressively across the exam score brackets from '0-59' up to '90-100'. This suggests a positive correlation between the amount of screen time and exam performance. From a business or educational perspective, this insight highlights that screen time could be linked to academic success, potentially due to students using digital tools and resources for studying. Educational programs could leverage this by promoting effective screen time habits to boost student outcomes, while also maintaining a balance with other health factors like sleep and physical exercise.

                                    The analysis indicates that higher parental education levels are associated with slightly better average exam scores among students. Specifically, students with parents holding a PhD have the highest average scores, followed by those with parents having a Master's degree. Those with parental education levels including High School, Bachelor, or Some College also demonstrate fairly high averages, though marginally lower. This correlation suggests that parental education may positively influence student academic outcomes, potentially through factors like parental support, expectations, or resource access. Educational institutions can leverage this insight by customizing their communication and support programs to families based on parental education level to enhance student performance.

                                    The code begins by importing necessary libraries including pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization. It reads the student dataset from a specified CSV file path into a pandas dataframe. It then groups the data by 'parental_education_level' and computes the mean exam score within each group to find the average exam score per parental education level. After calculating these averages, the dataset is sorted by exam score values in descending order to improve clarity in the subsequent visualization. A bar plot is created to display the average exam scores across different parental education levels using seaborn’s barplot function, followed by labeling and formatting enhancements for readability. Finally, the plot is saved as an image file and displayed.

                                    The analysis explored the relationship between students' internet quality and their average exam scores, categorized into Low, Medium, and High internet quality. The findings show that the average exam scores across these internet quality levels are very close, around 89.1 to 89.2, indicating that internet quality does not significantly affect exam performance in this data set. This suggests that factors other than internet quality may play more crucial roles in determining academic success. Educational institutions might focus on other influences like study habits or access to learning resources to improve outcomes.

                                    The business insight derived from this analysis is that students who participate in extracurricular activities tend to have a different average exam score compared to those who do not. By comparing these averages, the school or educational institution can assess whether encouraging involvement in extracurriculars supports better academic performance. If the data shows higher average exam scores for participants, it suggests a beneficial link, potentially guiding policies to promote holistic student development through extracurricular engagement. Conversely, if no significant difference or a negative impact is observed, resources might be redirected to focus more on academic study time. This KPI provides actionable insights into the impact of extracurricular participation on student academic outcomes.

                            Executive Summary:<br>
<br>
1. Impact of BMI on Medical Charges:
<ul>
<li>There is a clear positive correlation between Body Mass Index (BMI) and medical insurance charges.</li>
<li>Individuals with higher BMI tend to incur significantly higher medical costs, likely due to increased health risks associated with overweight and obesity.</li>
<li>This insight is critical for healthcare providers, insurers, and policymakers to design targeted interventions and cost management strategies addressing obesity-related health issues.</li>
</ul>
<br>
2. Correlation between Age and Medical Charges:
<ul>
<li>Analysis indicates a positive but moderate correlation between age and medical charges.</li>
<li>Older individuals generally incur higher medical expenses, reflecting age-related health deterioration.</li>
<li>This trend supports the need for age-based risk assessments and pricing models, enabling insurers to optimize coverage plans and allocate resources more effectively.</li>
</ul>
<br>
3. Limitations in Analyzing Other KPIs:
<ul>
<li>Attempts to analyze the impact of the number of children and sex on medical charges were unsuccessful due to repeated data access issues caused by environment resets.</li>
<li>Reliable analysis of these factors remains important for a comprehensive understanding of medical cost drivers and should be prioritized once data stability is ensured.</li>
</ul>
<br>
Overall, the key actionable insight is the identification of BMI and age as significant drivers of medical insurance costs. Strategic focus on managing obesity and tailoring policies for different age groups will likely improve cost control and risk management in healthcare insurance. Additional KPI analyses should be completed when stable data access is restored to enhance decision-making further.

                                    The analysis reveals that average insurance charges increase with age. Younger age groups (18-24) have the lowest average charges, around $9,011, while older groups like 55-64 years incur significantly higher costs, nearing $18,513. The oldest age group (65-74) lacks sufficient data for reliable average charge calculation. This trend suggests insurance pricing reflects the escalating health risks as people age. For the business, this implies opportunities to target younger customers with attractive rates while developing risk management strategies for older clients. Additionally, the missing data for the oldest group highlights a data collection gap to address.

                                    The code begins by importing the necessary libraries: pandas for data manipulation, and matplotlib and seaborn for visualization. It then loads the insurance dataset from the specified file path. The data's age column is categorized into defined age groups (bins) with labels such as '18-24' and '25-34'. Next, it calculates the mean insurance charge for each age group using groupby and mean functions. A bar plot is generated to visually represent average insurance charges across these age groups, with appropriate titles and axis labels. Finally, the plot is saved as an image file and displayed.

                                    The analysis indicates that average insurance charges differ by sex, with males incurring higher charges than females in the dataset. Specifically, on average, males are charged approximately $1,387 more than females. This difference could be influenced by factors such as differences in health risk profiles, lifestyle, or insurance pricing policies. For insurance companies, these insights are important for designing fair pricing models and targeted marketing strategies. It also suggests the value of further analysis considering other contributing variables like age, smoking status, region, or BMI to understand the disparity better.

                                    The analysis reveals a clear relationship between BMI categories and average insurance charges. Insurance costs increase with higher BMI categories, with individuals classified as 'Obese' incurring the highest average charges and those classified as 'Underweight' the lowest. This pattern indicates that BMI is a significant factor influencing insurance pricing likely due to the associated health risks and potential medical expenses. Insurance companies could leverage this insight to tailor their pricing models, risk assessments, and possibly encourage healthier lifestyles among policyholders to reduce costs.

                                    The analysis reveals how average insurance charges vary with the number of children an individual has. It shows that people with two to four children tend to have higher average insurance charges, peaking for those with three children. Those with zero or one child have lower average charges, and charges decrease notably for individuals with five children. This pattern suggests that the number of children correlates with factors influencing insurance costs, such as healthcare needs or lifestyle. However, the drop for five children might be due to sample size or other demographic variations. Insurance companies could utilize this insight to better tailor policies and premium pricing based on family size.

                                    The analysis reveals a significant difference in average insurance charges between smokers and non-smokers. Smokers incur much higher charges, approximately $32,050 on average, compared to nearly $8,434 for non-smokers. This indicates that smoking is strongly correlated with increased health risks and medical costs, which insurance companies factor into their pricing strategies by charging smokers higher premiums. This insight is valuable for risk-based pricing models and for encouraging smoking cessation programs to reduce insurance liabilities.

                                    The code begins by importing necessary libraries: pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib and seaborn for visualization. It loads the insurance dataset from a specified CSV file path into a DataFrame. Then, it calculates the average insurance charges by grouping the data according to the 'smoker' status and summarizing the 'charges' column using the mean function. This grouped data is stored for visualization. Next, it creates a bar plot with smoker status on the x-axis and average charges on the y-axis to visually compare the insurance costs between smokers and non-smokers.

                                    The analysis reveals that insurance charges vary significantly by region. The Southeast region exhibits the highest average insurance charges, suggesting that individuals there generally pay more, potentially due to higher healthcare costs, lifestyle factors, or demographic influences. The Northeast follows with moderately high charges, while the Northwest and Southwest regions show comparatively lower insurance costs. These insights indicate that the insurance provider should consider adopting region-specific pricing strategies and focus marketing and risk assessment efforts according to these regional differences to remain competitive and fair.

                                    The analysis examines the distribution of medical insurance charges across four different regions (southwest, southeast, northwest, northeast). It reveals notable differences in the range, median, and variability of charges by region. Specifically, the southeast region shows higher median charges and greater variability, suggesting it has higher costs and potentially greater risk exposure. Meanwhile, the southwest region has lower median charges and less variability. The northeast and northwest regions have similar distributions with moderate charges and variability. From a business standpoint, this suggests a tailored approach to pricing or service strategies may be necessary for different regions, with particular attention to cost management or risk assessment in the southeast region due to its wider charge variance and higher median.

                                    The analysis reveals that there are four unique regions in the dataset: southwest, northwest, northeast, and southeast. The 'southwest' and 'northwest' regions have the lowest average insurance charges, approximately $12,346.94 and $12,417.58 respectively. The 'northeast' and 'southeast' regions show higher average charges, around $13,406.38 and $14,735.41. Business-wise, this indicates regional variations in insurance costs which could reflect different healthcare cost structures or claim patterns. Insurance companies could leverage this insight to tailor pricing, marketing, or risk management strategies regionally to optimize competitiveness and profitability.

                                    The analysis reveals a weak to moderate positive correlation (approximately 0.30) between age and medical insurance charges, indicating that charges generally increase with age but with considerable variability. A significant finding is that smoking status greatly impacts charges, with smokers incurring much higher costs regardless of age. This suggests insurance companies should prioritize lifestyle factors like smoking alongside age for risk assessment and pricing. Tailored policies or premium adjustments could be considered especially for older clients, as their charges tend to be higher on average.

                                    The analysis reveals that there is a weak positive correlation (approximately 0.20) between BMI and insurance charges. This indicates that as BMI increases, insurance charges tend to increase slightly, but the relationship is not strong. There is significant variability in charges for any given BMI, suggesting that BMI alone is not a sufficient predictor of insurance costs. Insurance companies should consider multiple factors to assess risk and pricing rather than relying solely on BMI. This insight encourages a more comprehensive evaluation of risk profiles in insurance policy determination.

To evaluate the relationship between BMI and insurance charges, the analyst computed the Pearson correlation coefficient between the 'bmi' and 'charges' columns in the dataset. To visually support the correlation analysis, a scatter plot was created plotting BMI against charges, overlayed with a regression line to illustrate the trend. This approach allowed the analyst to see the degree and direction of association between BMI and charges. The correlation coefficient of around 0.20 was interpreted as a weak positive correlation, indicating that BMI has some impact on charges but is not the primary driver. The plot and coefficient were used to derive business insights regarding the modest influence of BMI on insurance pricing and the need to consider other factors.</li></ol>

                                    The analysis reveals that smoking status significantly influences insurance charges. On average, smokers incur insurance charges of $32,050.23, which is nearly 3.8 times higher than the $8,434.27 average charges for non-smokers. This substantial difference is attributed to the increased health risks associated with smoking, which lead to higher medical expenses covered by insurance. This insight is critical for insurance companies in terms of risk assessment and pricing strategies, and it highlights the potential cost savings for individuals who quit smoking.

                                    The analysis reveals a relationship between the number of children and average insurance charges. Insurance charges generally increase with the number of children up to 3, indicating higher costs for families with 2 to 3 children. However, there is a noticeable decrease in average charges for families with 4 or 5 children, which could be due to specific demographic factors or discounts. These insights can help insurance companies in refining their pricing models and risk assessments based on family size.

                                    The analysis reveals that the age distribution among insurance clients is broad, with a dense concentration in younger age groups around 18 to 20 years, and a gradual decline in the older age ranges. Medical charges are observed to generally increase with age, indicating higher healthcare costs for older individuals. However, there is significant variability in charges across all ages, suggesting that factors beyond age, such as health conditions or smoking habits, impact costs. These insights suggest that insurance premiums should be adjusted to account for age-related risk and that personalized policies or targeted preventative interventions could improve risk management and customer satisfaction.

                                    The code first loads the insurance dataset into a pandas DataFrame and computes basic descriptive statistics for age and medical charges. Then, it creates two visualizations side-by-side using matplotlib and seaborn: a histogram with a KDE overlay showing the distribution of individual ages, and a scatter plot displaying the relationship between age and medical charges, where each point corresponds to an individual's charges at a given age. The plot is saved as an image file and displayed.

        <ol class="steps-list"><li>The analyst started by loading the insurance data and inspecting its content. Next, they computed summary statistics for the 'age' and 'charges' fields to understand the central tendencies and variability. Then, the analyst produced visualizations: a histogram to capture how many individuals fall into each age group, and a scatter plot to explore how charges change with age. They interpreted the plots to identify patterns such as the concentration of younger individuals and the trend of rising charges with age alongside variability. This combined statistical and visual approach allowed the analyst to derive actionable business insights about risk and cost variability in insurance pricing.</li></ol>
